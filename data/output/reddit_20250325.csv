1jintms,What makes a someone the 1% DE?,"So I'm new to the industry and I have the impression that practical experience is much more valued that higher education. One simply needs know how to program these systems where large amounts of data are processed and stored.

1jiva8y,What actually defines a DataFrame?,"I fear this is more a philosophical question then a technical one but I am a bit confused. I’ve been thinking a lot about what makes something a DataFrame, not just in terms of syntax or library, but from a conceptual standpoint.

My current definition is as such:

>A DataFrame is a language native, programmable interface for querying and transforming tabular data. Its designed to be embedded directly in general purpose programming workflows.

I like this because it focuses on what a DataFrame *is for*, rather than what specific tools or libraries implement it.

I think however that this definition is too general and can lead to anything tabular with an API being described as a DF.

  
Properties that are not exclusive across DataFrames which I previously thought defined them:

* mutability
   * pandas: mutable, you can add/remove/overwrite columns directly.
   * Spark DataFrames: immutable, transformations return new logical plans.
   * Polars (lazy mode): immutable, transformations build a new plan.
* execution model
   * pandas: eager, executes immediately.
   * Spark / Polars (lazy): lazy, builds DAGs and executes on trigger.
* in memory
   * pandas / polars: usually in-memory.
   * Spark: can spill to disk or operate on distributed data.
   * Ibist: abstract, backend might not be memory-bound at all.

Curious how others would describe and define DataFrames.

1jigk9j,Well-Designed Data Warehouse Examples,"I am working to restructure a legacy “data warehouse”. 

Current state: Every table is directly copied directly from the application’s transactional database with slight name updates on the columns.

Hundreds of views have been created to be used for analytics.

Is this more likely a case of it just being under-developed? With it becoming much more respectable and viable once it's more polished and complete.

Or are the core components of the product so poor that it'll likely continue to be disliked for the foreseeable future?

If I recall correctly, years ago, people disliked Power BI quite a bit when compared to something like Tableau. However, over time, the narrative shifted quite a bit and support plus popularity of BI increased drastically. I'm curious if Fabric will have a similar trajectory.

1jinyx2,"Apache Flink 2.0.0 is out and has deep integration with Apache Paimon - strengthening the Streaming Lakehouse architecture, making Flink a leading solution for real-time data lake use cases.","By leveraging Flink as a stream-batch unified processing engine and Paimon as a stream-batch unified lake format, the Streaming Lakehouse architecture has enabled real-time data freshness for lakehouse. In Flink 2.0, the Flink community has partnered closely with the Paimon community, leveraging each other’s strengths and cutting-edge features, resulting in significant enhancements and optimizations.

* Nested projection pushdown is now supported when interacting with Paimon data sources, significantly reducing IO overhead and enhancing performance in scenarios involving complex data structures.
* Lookup join performance has been substantially improved when utilizing Paimon as the dimensional table. This enhancement is achieved by aligning data with the bucketing mechanism of the Paimon table, thereby significantly reducing the volume of data each lookup join task needs to retrieve, cache, and process from Paimon.
* All Paimon maintenance actions (such as compaction, managing snapshots/branches/tags, etc.) are now easily executable via Flink SQL call procedures, enhanced with named parameter support that can work with any subset of optional parameters.
* Writing data into Paimon in batch mode with automatic parallelism deciding used to be problematic. This issue has been resolved by ensuring correct bucketing through a fixed parallelism strategy, while applying the automatic parallelism strategy in scenarios where bucketing is irrelevant.
* For Materialized Table, the new stream-batch unified table type in Flink SQL, Paimon serves as the first and sole supported catalog, providing a consistent development experience.

I would be scolded for not understanding and these tasks would be given to me and no one else.

I love to code that's why I would have liked to stay in Data Engineering also I have forgotten max of the software dev concepts so am unable to apply them anywhere.

I have been applying to DE roles but have not got any reply(Linkedin, Glassdoor, Naukri).

Imagine a dataset like:

    data = [

        (2, ""bob2"", ""acct"", 202001),
        (3, ""bob3"", ""eng"", 202011),
        (4, ""bob4"", ""data"", 202012),
        (5, ""bob5"", ""acct"", 202501),
    ]

    schema = [""id"", ""name"", ""department"", ""joined_date""]
    df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)
    df = df.repartition(len(set(d[3] for d in data)), ""joined_date"")
    df.foreachPartition(lambda it: print(list(it)))

The above example prints out the partition distribution that I expect:

    [Row(3, bob3, eng, 202011)]
    [Row(1, bob, acct, 202001), Row(2, bob2, acct, 202001)]
    [Row(4, bob4, data, 202012)]
    [Row(5, bob5, acct, 202501)]

But, if the data is:

    data = [
        (1, ""bob"", ""acct"", 202001),
        (2, ""bob2"", ""acct"", 202001),

        (4, ""bob4"", ""data"", 202012),
        (5, ""bob5"", ""acct"", 202002),

Would appreciate inputs of folks who have tried any or all of these.",Confident_Dinner_872,0,24-03-25 11:07,FALSE,FALSE,0.67
1jj6s1z,Need data engineers help for input on open source ETL/ELT tool we are building,"Hello Community,

We released MVP for a open source ETL tool we have been working on

mu-pipelines: [https://mosaicsoft-data.github.io/mu-pipelines-doc/getting-started/](https://mosaicsoft-data.github.io/mu-pipelines-doc/getting-started/)

Through out my journey i was never a fan of UI driven tools that we have for ETL or vendor lock in closed code tool. So we built tool that we wish we had. It unlocks capabilities like add CI/CD, merge approvals etc and build and grow open source community.

It is a python/pyspark based configuration driven ETL tool. I think of it as lego blocks: We build functionality with basic bricks like ingest, transform, destination and users can mix and match those bricks ( or bring their own brick) to create pipelines.

For MVP we have basic functionality like read from CSV, sql transformation, write to CSV, delta, iceberg. We would like to add talk to data engineers, understand use case and then build on it. Please feel free add in comments, DM me or email us on [mupipelines@gmail.com](mailto:mupipelines@gmail.com).

Thank you again for everyone willing to help.

Looking forward to your inputs and feedback.

1jj401k,Keep or leave Ab Initio for good to become a DE?,"Hi DE, community I've been reading a lot of post in this sub, expecting to read more of Ab>I but it seems that other technologies overtake the conversations. I would like to get advice on various subjects, I'm currently unemployed due lack of positions as Ab>I Dev since January. I'm not from the US so there is only a few, but only for Juniors/Intern as I have 5+ yoe. I'm trying to keep on this path but seems like a long-term position crisis.

Because of this I've been thinking to transition to DE but it's a start from 0, I feel very strange as I'm trying to learn everything at once to understand how a project might be built, coming from a ""low-code"" development tool. So, currently I've bought a couple courses for DE (PySpark, PL/SQL, Python, Snowflake, AWS Architecture), to understand the basics, also I have only touched SQL, but across these years I haven't written any query with more that 7 lines. Said this as a bit of context of personal situation I would like to ask the following

\- how or when can I say I'm ready to apply for a DE Jr position, having only experience as Ab>I Dev

\- how much time you have spent learning/writing your projects, did you go full 24/7 coding?

\- how a mentoring works as I haven't had any  (beside the obvious)

  
I appreciate the advice, responses, etc. Have a good one :)",jpopgg,10,24-03-25 22:30,FALSE,FALSE,0.33
